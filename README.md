### Howdy ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Chris, and I'm a backend C# and Typescript developer. I spend most of my time (whether at work or at home) writing code to harvest data. At work this is from dozens of internal corporate systems around the world that enable us to ensure licensing and security compliance for nearly 100,000 computers and devices, but in my free time it's usually from various sources around the web.

[Once](https://github.com/chrismeller/fourchan-monitor) or [twice](https://github.com/chrismeller/StarbucksScraper) that's been (politely) polling an API. [More](https://github.com/chrismeller/SCSpendingTransparency) often [it involves](https://github.com/chrismeller/SCCourtOpinionsSharp) page [scraping](https://github.com/chrismeller/SCFoodScores) a [government website](https://github.com/chrismeller/schptrafficinfo), sometimes [even with](https://github.com/chrismeller/SCAlcoholLicenses) Selenium, to provide data in the format it should have been made available in all along.

I've also scraped millions of LastFM profiles, processed 10's of gigabytes of US Census data to extract a definitive list of zip codes, digitized thousands of South Carolina school district purchase order and credit card transactions, and [filed dozens](https://www.muckrock.com/accounts/profile/chrismeller/) of Freedom of Information Act requests. Most recently, I'm [harvesting traffic camera footage](https://github.com/chrismeller/TLLCameras) to track the arrival and departure of trams because I don't think the schedules are reliable.
