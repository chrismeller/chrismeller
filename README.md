### Howdy ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Chris, and I'm a backend C# and Typescript developer. I spend most of my time (whether at work or at home) writing code to harvest data. At work this is from dozens of internal corporate systems around the world that enable us to ensure licensing and security compliance for nearly 100,000 computers and devices, but in my free time it's usually from various sources around the web.

[Once](https://github.com/chrismeller/fourchan-monitor) or [twice](https://github.com/chrismeller/StarbucksScraper) that's been (politely) polling an API. [More](https://github.com/chrismeller/SCSpendingTransparency) often [it involves](https://github.com/chrismeller/SCCourtOpinionsSharp) page [scraping](https://github.com/chrismeller/SCFoodScores) a [government website](https://github.com/chrismeller/schptrafficinfo) or [two](https://github.com/chrismeller/SLEDHelicopter), sometimes [even with](https://github.com/chrismeller/SCAlcoholLicenses) Selenium, to provide data in the format it should have been made available in all along.

My Starbucks dataset has been referenced by many "name brand" news agencies, including: [QZ](https://qz.com/208457/a-cartographic-guide-to-starbucks-global-domination/), [CBS 2 Chicago](https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2014/05/28/a-starbucks-on-every-street-corner-in-downtown-chicago-its-pretty-close/), [Politico](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/06/23/richard-florida-cities-independent-donald-trump-215288), and [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2015/feb/03/starbucks-gentrification-real-estate-prices). It's also been cited without attribution by [Computer World](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2894448/useful-new-r-packages-for-data-visualization-and-analysis.html) and [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/gun-dealers-laws-us-states-starbucks-2017-10), who are still on my list and should cry themselves to sleep every night, dreaming of forgiveness. It's been referenced in academia by a project at [the Ohio State University]() and in a [joint paper](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~jiasi/pub/sharing_wiopt17.pdf) from Princeton, UC Riverside, Carnegie Mellon, and City University Hong Kong presented at the 2017 15th [IEEE International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/7951216/proceeding).

I've also scraped millions of LastFM profiles, processed 10's of gigabytes of TIGER/Line US Census data files to extract a definitive list of zip codes, digitized thousands of South Carolina school district purchase order and credit card transactions, and [filed dozens](https://www.muckrock.com/accounts/profile/chrismeller/) of Freedom of Information Act requests. Most recently, I'm [harvesting traffic camera footage](https://github.com/chrismeller/TLLCameras) to track the arrival and departure of trams because I don't think the schedules are reliable.
